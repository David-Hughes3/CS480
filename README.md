Kingdoms Game is an augmented reality mobile multiplayer game in which two 
players compete to control zones to gain more points.

Technology Stack:
- React Native
- Node.js with Express
- MongoDB

The backend is designed as a REST API following the JSend 
standards. The sdk is a wrapper for the API. 
The frontend utilizes the sdk to
send and receive info from the server for users & games.

The entire project is like 3 smaller projects we'd developed
that work together:
- frontend
- sdk
- backend
